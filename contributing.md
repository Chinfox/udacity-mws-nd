Thank you for taking time to contribute. We really appreciate your help.

# Contribution guidelines

Awesome lists are a curation, not a collection. We want to make it easier for students to find additional learning resources in the context of this scholarship. Quality matters and not quantity. This is why we cannot accept every submission. However, we are always open for feedback to ensure a certain level of awesomeness :wink:

but **what is awesome?**

## Awesome = Community

Here are some things that we consider as an awesome resource:

- highly recommended by other contributors or fellow students
- hard to find for various reasons
- helpful if you struggle with a concept by a different way of teaching 
- you wish you had known this resource when you started taking this course

Since the selection process is community-driven, you will get GitHub reactions from others for your submission. This gives you a way to find out if you are on the right track.

## Contributing
